# Xm-Tradepoint_Interview-Project
This is an Interview project, and the objective is to translate a figma design into a responsive Page.
The project has 3 css files one for mobile responsiveness, one for some minor utilities, and the main style file.
I also used some javaScript inorder to validate the email and password as per client validation rules, and Server validation rules after form submission.

This was a very interesting project to work on, as I got to learn quite alot.

## NOTES
Some of the functionalies and responsiveness are not completely done, as I was pressed on time, but nevertheless a shipped product is better than an unfinished project as it can always be improved upon.

#The slider is not fully complete
#The article gridbox needs a bit of tweaking in-order to center while navigating through different screen sizes.
These are just two among the few that needs to be worked on.

# Stack used: 
HTML
CSS
JS
